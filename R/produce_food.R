#' Calcualte yields and whatnot
#'
#'Here households calculate how much land they need, pull the
#'crop yield from the environment, remember the yield, and
#'determine their harvests by multiplying the yield by the amount
#'of land they have (also removing some of the crop to save as
#'seed for next year).
#' @param households Tibble of household agents.
