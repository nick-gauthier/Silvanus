#' Zoom functions
#'
#' These are  internal convencience functions used by the *_dynamics commands
#' that allow functions meant for one level to be called from another level.
#' zoom_in takes a settlement or household tibble and produces as household or
#' individuals tibble, respectively. zoom_out does the opposite.
