#' Individual-level death and reproduction according to age-specific, food-limited fertility and mortality rates
#'
#' This function allows household agents to add or remove individual
#' agents via birth and death. The tibble of households is first unnested
#' to access the tibble of individuals. Then, the probability of
#' giving birth is calculated for each individual from its age and
#' the food ratio of its household. Finally, the probability is
#' in a random bernoulli trial to determine how many babies are
#' actually born to each household each year. Babies are added to
#' the household by adding rows to the individual's tibble with Age = 1.
#' @param households Tibble of household agents containing nested tibbles of individual agents

# basically, I wonder if there current implementation "misses" a year of life. Something to think about, although its not a huge deal rn.
